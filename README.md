# QueryCop

# Description

A query tracker for ActiveRecord and Rspec that helps Rails developers be aware of how many database lookups their code is generating.

By setting the maximum allowed query count in the test, it also helps the query count become explicit and have more robust performance-aware regression tests.

The gem currently only works with sqlite3, psql and mysql.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'query_cop'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install query_cop

## Usage


In any of your rspec examples, you can add
```
   with_allowed_max_query_count(#{max_allowed_query_count}) do
    # actions you want to keep track of queries for
  end
```
The spec will fail if the actual generated amount of queries exceed the number of queries that you allowed as max.

It will also print out the failure message with the generated queries like this.

```
Failure/Error:
             with_allowed_max_query_count(1) do
               get "/cars.json"
             end

             Allowed maximum query count: 1
             Actual generated query count: 2
             Here is the list of generated queries:
             SELECT  "cars".* FROM "cars" LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2
             SELECT "license_plates".* FROM "license_plates" WHERE "license_plates"."car_id" = $1
```

Within the `with_allowed_max_query_count` block, you can also directly access the current list of queries by calling `QueryCop::QueryTracker.queries`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
